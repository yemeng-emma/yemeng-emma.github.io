    "text": "Hello! Thank you for visiting my website.\nI am Meng Ye, a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. My research examines the roles of nonprofits amid blurring sector boundaries, including nonprofit commercialization, government retrenchment, and cross-sector collaboration. I also study nonprofit finance and regulations.\nMy work has appeared in Public Performance & Management Review, Journal of Asian Public Policy, Nonprofit Policy Forum, and Academy of Management Proceedings, among others. My research has been recognized by the AOM PNP Section Best Conference Paper Award and the ARNOVA NPPFM Section Woods Bowman Student Award, and supported by multiple academic grants.\nI am grateful for the mentorship of a vibrant research community, including the APPAM Equity & Inclusion Fellowship, ARNOVA Doctoral Fellows, and NML-ESS Nonprofit Early Scholars Fellowship, and I strive to give back by serving as Editorial Manager of the International Journal of Public Administration, as a member of the ARNOVA Development Committee, and as a peer reviewer for several journals.\nBefore pursuing my Ph.D., I spent six years working in think tanks, advising organizations such as the Asian Development Bank and leading research and consultancy projects funded by the Ford Foundation and the Gates Foundation. I take pride in my diverse disciplinary background. As a lawyer turned statistics enthusiast, I strive to combine the richness of stories and contextual detail with the rigor and generalizability of systematic analysis to help solve the pressing challenges of our shared communities."

    "text": "I.Ask an Interesting Question\nDescribe the question that you hope to answer with big data. Why does it interest you and/or why is it important?\nMost research starts with a large question and narrows to a very specific one that can be answered once you know more about what data is available to answer the question and how it can be analyzed. If you’re undecided at this point in the semester what question you’ll propose to answer, describe ones that cluster around the same topic for this assignment.\nFor example, I’m interested in understanding the relationship between needle aversion and COVID vaccination rates. I think that the language and imagery used to encourage vaccination is having the opposite effect. Nearly every advertisement or news segment about COVID vaccination shows a needle going in an arm (up close!) and uses language like “get the shot” or “jab,” which evokes negative feelings in most people (e.g., like going to the dentist or booster shots as a child). For those who also have fears that the vaccination is risky, these images and words reduce the likelihood that they’ll get a vaccine. I hypothesize that the ubiquity and volume of this imagery on TV and social media (big data) is reinforcing needle aversion to an extent that it’s driving down vaccination rates. So, my research question is “Has intense exposure to imagery and language of needles decreased COVID vaccination rates in the United States?” If a relationship exists, removing needle imagery and language from mass media could improve vaccination compliance and lower the threat of COVID to public health.",
